Overview
========

``tutorial`` directory supplements the README_. It provides the reader
with a tutorial regarding the most commonly used commands for jumping
between files in Vim/Neovim in an efficient way. Understand how to move
between files in Vim increases productivity and makes the workflow in
Vim more enjoyable.

.. _README: ../README.rst


Instructions for Users
======================

To start the tutorial do the following:

* See `configuration <../README.rst#configuration>` to set your
  ``~/.vimrc`` or ``~/.config/nvim/init.vim``

* Open `place_01.rst <place_01.rst>`_ file in Vim

  .. code:: bash

    $ vim place_01.rst

  or Neovim

  .. code:: bash

    $ nvim place_01.rst

* Follow the instructions from there on in your Vim/Neovim session

.. Attention::

  The tutorials are writen in reStructuredText (markup langauge, see
  `here <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_), but this
  shouldn't be a problem to read the text and follow the instructuions.
  Only thing that might happen is that you pick up on reStructuredText
  along the way. Commands (as well as the outputs of the commands) are
  enclosed between double quotes. This means that if the tutorial
  suggests to type ``command`` you should type it in your Vim session
  without the double quotes.
